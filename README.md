# BKacprzyk-Marketing-page

Hello, thank you for being interested in my project. This is currently deployed on Netlify at https://fervent-lewin-2d82f9.netlify.com.

~ I'm used Visual Studio Version 16.2.5. 

~ The only additional feature I used in Visual Studio was the spell checker add on. 

~ (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EWoodruff.VisualStudioSpellCheckerVS2017andLater)

~ I used HTML, CSS, and a few lines of JavaScript to create this website. The JavaScript was only to make the dropdown menu on mobile work properly.
  
~ All of my images were found on https://pixabay.com plus I found a barbell ico for my title icon on https://icons8.com/icon/1785/barbell.
